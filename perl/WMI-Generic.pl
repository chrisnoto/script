# WMI-Generic.pl
# List all the available WMI properties for a various WMI Class on a remote or local box
# Version 1.0
# Tested on W2K and AS630 (with clients using W2K and NT4)

# Dumps a lot of information similar to the WMI SDK Utility, WBEMDUMP
#    If you were to run the command WBEMDUMP /M2 \\COMPUTER\root\CIMV2 Win32_Classname
#      *Where:
#         -COMPUTER is a valid computer, and
#         -Win32_Classname is a valid calss name

# Valid Classnames can be found in the WMI SDK
# Class names can also found at:

# Here's a list of a few Helpful classes to get you started.
# Win32_ComputerSystem
# Win32_Processor
# Win32_TapeDrive
# Win32_TimeZone

# Last note.  If a class has a property that your computer doesn't show a value for, it
# isn't necessarily a problem with the script, OLE or WMI, but that the property isn't/wasn't
# populated in WMI for some reason

#     *Note: This may not return any information due
#            to the system you are querying not having a tape drive!
#     *Where the following command should return information (and for both systems)
# perl wmi-generic.pl computername Win32_ComputerSystem computername2 Win32_Processor
#     *And lastly, the asterisk can be used when looking for local computer information
# perl wmi-generic.pl * Win32_ComputerSystem computername2 Win32_Processor
